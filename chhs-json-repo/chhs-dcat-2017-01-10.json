Data are reported for January – September 2015 due to coding changes from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM/PCS for procedures, which began 10/1/2015. Comparisons across years should be made with caution since previous years’ results are based on 12 months of data, while this analysis is based on 9 months of data. The 2015 data may differ from previous years due to the coding change.  For all types of cancer surgeries, except breast cancer, the dataset contains surgeries performed in the inpatient hospital setting.  For breast cancer surgeries, this dataset includes procedures performed in inpatient and outpatient settings.",

  "description" : "This data is from the California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP) in the California Department of Public Health. The primary purpose of the CSCP is to collect information on hazardous and potentially hazardous ingredients in cosmetic products sold in California and to make this information available to the public. For all cosmetic products sold in California, the California Safe Cosmetics Act requires the manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor named on the product label to provide to the CSCP a list of all cosmetic products that contain any ingredients known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, or other developmental or reproductive harm. The CSCP maintains a list of “reportable” ingredients. Companies with reportable ingredients in their products must submit information to the California Safe Cosmetics Program if the company: •Has annual aggregate sales of cosmetic products of one million dollars or more, and •Has sold cosmetic products in California on or after January 1, 2007. The data table consists of: label names of cosmetic/personal care products, company/manufacturer names, product brand names, product categories, Chemical Abstracts Service registry numbers (CAS#) of the reported chemical ingredients, names of reported chemical ingredients, the number of reported chemicals for each product, and dates of reporting, product discontinuation or reformulation if applicable. The data reflect information that has been reported to the CSCP. All products containing carcinogens or developmental or reproductive toxicants may not be included, due to companies failing to report.",

Living wage is the wage needed to cover basic family expenses (basic needs budget) plus all relevant taxes; it does not include publicly provided income or housing assistance.  The percent of families below the living wage was calculated using data from the Living Wage Calculator (http://livingwage.mit.edu/) and the U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey. The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/HealthyCommunityIndicators.aspx). The living wage is the wage or annual income that covers the cost of the bare necessities of life for a worker and his/her family. These necessities include housing, transportation, food, childcare, health care, and payment of taxes.  Low income populations and non-white race/ethnic have disproportionately lower wages, poorer housing, and higher levels of food insecurity.

  "description" : "Rehabilitation acute care hospitals (REHABs) are defined by the Social Security Administration as providing care to evaluate and restore function. This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA BSI) reported by  California REHABs to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), during the time period January through December 2013. MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO MRSA BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The MRSA BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time for REHABs. In addition to patient-based risk factors, the unadjusted REHAB MRSA BSI rates herein are also affected by facility bed size, community prevalence rate, clinical and infection control practices, and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying MRSA BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect MRSA BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within REHABs should still be made with caution. That is, differences in rates within this hospital type can represent other factors besides differences in infection and transmission prevention practices.

  "description" : "This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) standardized infection ratios (SIR) of hospital onset (HO) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream Infections (MRSA BSI) reported by  California general acute care hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care hospitals. The HO MRSA BSI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of MRSA BSI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2013 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent MRSA BSI rate data.  MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when the first positive blood test is obtained after the third day of hospitalization. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO MRSA BSI incidence include hospital bed size, affiliation with a medical school, and the community burden of MRSA BSI as observed in patients admitted to the hospital. Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO MRSA BSI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring MRSA BSI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO MRSA BSI predicted less than one if the number of HO MRSA BSI observed was greater than zero. For each hospital with a MRSA BSI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number. Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s MRSA BSI SIR as: \r\n• No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, \r\n• Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or \r\n• Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf",

VRE BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO VRE BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The VRE BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time. The unadjusted VRE BSI rates herein are also affected by clinical and infection control practices and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying VRE BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect VRE BSI rates.

  "description" : "Special Care Areas (SCA) are nursing care areas which specialize in patients who undergo bone marrow (stem cell) transplant for the treatment of various disorders; or require management and treatment for cancer and/or blood disorders; or require postoperative care after solid organ transplant. This table shows the hospital-specific central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data by patient care locations in Special Care Areas. The CLABSI data for each hospital patient care location include number of CLABSIs, central line-days and patient days, CLABSI rates per 1000 line days and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed a statistical analysis to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than California average rates. California average rates for 2013 can be found at http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Documents/2013-CLABSI-T1.pdf. CLABSI rates are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, it cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols.

  "description" : "Wards General Care Areas include the following types of locations: stepdown general care locations specializing in patients that are hemodynamically stable; medical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of nonsurgical conditions; medical/surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of medical and/or surgical conditions; surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment for pre- or post-surgical conditions; long-term acute care locations specializing in patients requiring an extended stay in an acute care environment; rehabilitation general care locations providing care to patients who have lost function;  labor, delivery, postpartum general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of normal and high risk pregnancy patients; behavioral general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients with acute psychiatric or behavioral disorders; jail general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients who are in custody of law enforcement during their treatment; and pediatric general care locations providing evaluation or treatment to any patient less than or equal to 18 years of age for any medical or surgical condition. This table shows the hospital-specific central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) data by patient care locations classified as Wards. The CLABSI data for each hospital patient care location include number of CLABSIs, central line-days and patient days, CLABSI rates per 1000 line days and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed a statistical analysis to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than California average rates. California average rates for 2013 can be found at http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Documents/2013-CLABSI-T1.pdf. CLABSI rates are affected by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance practices, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, it cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may reflect less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including failure to appropriately apply standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or more aggressive infection surveillance including more consistent application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, readers should consider comparisons between two time periods cautiously, as more time is needed to determine if changes will be sustained, and therefore, more meaningful.

  "description" : "This 2014 central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates file includes four patient care areas: 1) Critical Care Areas (CCAs) are nursing care areas that provide intensive observation, diagnosis, and therapeutic procedures for patients who are critically ill. These areas exclude step-down, intermediate, or telemetry care areas. 2) Neonatal Critical Care (NCC) Areas specialize in Level II/III and/or Level III critical care provided to newborns and infants. 3) General Care Areas (WARDS) include the following types of locations: stepdown general care locations specializing in patients that are hemodynamically stable; medical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of nonsurgical conditions; medical/surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of medical and/or surgical conditions; surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment for pre- or post-surgical conditions; long-term acute care locations specializing in patients requiring an extended stay in an acute care environment; adult rehabilitation general care locations providing care to patients who have lost function;  labor, delivery, recovery, postpartum general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of normal and high risk pregnancy patients; behavioral general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients with acute psychiatric or behavioral disorders; jail general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients who are in custody of law enforcement during their treatment; and pediatric general care locations providing evaluation or treatment to any patient less than or equal to 18 years of age for any medical or surgical condition. 4) Special Care Areas (SCA) are nursing care areas which specialize in patients who undergo bone marrow (stem cell) transplant for the treatment of various disorders; or require management and treatment for cancer and/or blood disorders; or require postoperative care after solid organ transplant.  Starting with this 2014 SCA file, six treatment locations were added: \"Oncology - Medical/Surgical Critical Care\", Permanent and Temporary Central Line Days, \"Oncology - General Hematology/Oncology Ward\", Permanent and Temporary Central Line Days, and \"Oncology Solid Tumor Ward\", Permanent and Temporary Central Line Days.   This combined CLABSI rates table shows the hospital-specific CLABSI data and central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent by patient care locations in CCAs, NCCs and one new treatment area within SCA, \"Oncology - Medical/Surgical Critical Care\", Permanent and Central Line Days. The CLABSI measures include the number of CLABSIs, central line-days, patient days, CLABSI rates and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed statistical analyses to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than the California average rates by patient care locations. We know CLABSI rates are influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance procedures, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, this data risk adjusted procedure cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may result from less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including the failure to consistently  apply all currently accepted standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect the failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or use more aggressive infection surveillance methods that can include the application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Finally, readers should understand the limitations of results based on the analysis of only two time periods, since several years of CLABSI data are required to determine if changes observed from one year to the next will be sustained over multiple years, and therefore, represent clinically meaningful outcomes.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.",

  "description" : "Long-term acute care is a hospital defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as a licensed general acute care hospital providing care for patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay for all patients of greater than 25 days. This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported by California long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals.  The hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days. The rates are not risk adjusted and may reflect factors in the hospital that can affect the occurrence of CDI, such as transmission of the C. difficile bacteria and use of antimicrobials. CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Differences in rates for LTAC hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in LTAC hospitals is provided separately from the rates in rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  Patients in LTAC hospitals have longer lengths of stay, an established risk factor for CDI.  Also, specifically for LTAC and rehabilitation acute care hospitals, we include whether a hospital uses the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect CDI.  In this table, hospital rates of CDI for LTAC hospitals have not been adjusted to account for the differences in sensitivity between PCR and other laboratory testing methods; therefore, rates from hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable.

  "description" : "This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) standardized infection ratios (SIR) of hospital onset (HO) Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) reported by  California general acute care hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  The HO CDI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of CDI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2014 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent CDI rate data.  CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO CDI incidence include the type of CDI test used by the hospital, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical school, hospital bed size, and the burden of community-onset CDI in patients admitted to the hospital.  Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. Hospitals with NHSN-predicted number of HO CDI cases <1 had no SIRs calculated by NHSN due to less precise comparisons.   For each hospital with a CDI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number.  Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s CDI SIR as indicating: \r\n• No Different - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, \r\n• Higher - higher or more infections than predicted, or \r\n• Lower - lower or fewer infections than predicted.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.",

The California Tobacco Control Program coordinates statewide tobacco control efforts and funds the California Student Tobacco Survey (CSTS). The data table shows the current smoking prevalence from 2001 to 2012 for California high school youth by selected demographics. Current cigarette smoking was defined as having smoked on one or more days during the past 30 days prior to the survey. \r\nIn statistics, a confidence interval is a measure of the reliability of an estimate. It is a type of interval estimate of a population parameter. The CSTS is a large-scale biennial survey, in-school student survey administered to middle (grades 6-8) and high school (grades 9-12) students. Topics of the survey include tobacco-use behavior, beliefs about the health consequences of using tobacco products from cigarettes, smokeless, to kreteks (clove/tobacco cigarettes), exposure to tobacco education in schools, and exposure to tobacco advertising. The survey provides coverage of topics such as smoking behaviors, attitudes, knowledge, and awareness about tobacco and tobacco use prevention.",

  "description" : "This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/. The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) module of the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) asks respondents questions about eight different traumatic childhood experiences that occurred before the age of 18. These include verbal/emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and negative household situations including the incarceration of an adult, alcohol or drug abuse by an adult, violence between adults, mental illness of a household member, and parental divorce or separation. A cumulative ACEs score is calculated for each respondent by counting the number of these items that a respondent reported experiencing, creating a score ranging from 0 to 8.",

  "description" : "This is a source dataset for a Let's Get Healthy California indicator at https://letsgethealthy.ca.gov/.\r\nInfant Mortality is defined as the number of deaths in infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births. Infant mortality is often used as an indicator to measure the health and well-being of a community, because factors affecting the health of entire populations can also impact the mortality rate of infants. Although California’s infant mortality rate is better than the national average, there are significant disparities, with African American babies dying at more than twice the rate of other groups.\r\nData are from the Birth Cohort Files. The infant mortality indicator computed from the birth cohort file comprises birth certificate information on all births that occur in a calendar year (denominator) plus death certificate information linked to the birth certificate for those infants who were born in that year but subsequently died within 12 months of birth (numerator). Studies of infant mortality that are based on information from death certificates alone have been found to underestimate infant death rates for infants of all race/ethnic groups and especially for certain race/ethnic groups, due to problems such as confusion about event registration requirements, incomplete data, and transfers of newborns from one facility to another for medical care. \r\nNote there is a separate data table \"Infant Mortality by Race/Ethnicity\" which is based on death records only, which is more timely but less accurate than the Birth Cohort File.\r\nSingle year shown to provide state-level data and county totals for the most recent year. Numerator: Infants deaths (under age 1 year). Denominator: Live births occurring to California state residents. Multiple years aggregated to allow for stratification at the county level.\r\nFor this indicator, race/ethnicity is based on the birth certificate information, which records the race/ethnicity of the mother. The mother can “decline to state”; this is considered to be a valid response. These responses are not displayed on the indicator visualization.",

  "description" : "This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) vancomycin-resistant Enterococci bloodstream infections (VRE BSI) reported by California general acute care hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), during the time period January through December 2015, grouped by hospital type: Critical access acute care hospital (CAH; defined as certain facilities that participate in Medicare and that are designated by states through a protocol); long-term acute care hospital (LTAC; defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days); major teaching acute care hospital (MTAC; a hospital that self-identifies and is confirmed by California Department of Public Health (CDPH) as providing an important part of the teaching program of a medical school); pediatric acute care hospital (PED; a hospital defined by CDPH as a stand-alone children's hospital); free-standing rehabilitation acute care hospital and rehabilitation unit with its own Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services certification number (REHAB; defined by the Social Security Administration as providing care to evaluate and restore function); or community hospital (COM; a hospital not classified as one of the above other types). VRE BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO VRE BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The VRE BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time. The unadjusted VRE BSI rates herein are also affected by clinical and infection control practices and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying VRE BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect VRE BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within type groups (strata) should still be made with caution.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.",

  "description" : "This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) risk adjusted Standardized infection ratios (SIR) for surgical site infections (SSIs)  reported by a hospital for 24 Operative procedures that are listed in the Data Dictionary. The SIR is calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted infections. The number of predicted infections is calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline time period 2006 through 2008, which represents a reference population’s SSI experience. The SIR calculated only if the number of observed is at least one, to enforce a minimum precision criterion and these SIRs are based on the date of procedure, not the date of event. All procedure and infection data entered before May 3, 2016 for surgical procedures performed between January 1 and December 31, 2015 were downloaded from NHSN for this data release. The SIR used for this table is risk adjusted SIR that considers only complex SSI identified during hospital Admission or Readmission to the same hospital following inpatient surgeries and hereafter referred to as SIR.

  "description" : "Rehabilitation acute hospitals are hospitals with inpatient wards for evaluation and restoration of function to patients who have lost function due to acute or chronic pain, musculoskeletal problems, stroke, or catastrophic events resulting in complete or partial paralysis. These hospitals were self-identified through National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA BSI) reported by California free-standing rehabilitation acute care hospitals and rehabilitation units with their own Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services certification number (CCN).  MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO MRSA BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The MRSA BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time for REHABs. In addition to patient-based risk factors, the unadjusted REHAB MRSA BSI rates herein are also affected by facility bed size, community prevalence rate, clinical and infection control practices, and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying MRSA BSI rates by hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect MRSA BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within REHABs should still be made with caution. That is, differences in rates within this hospital type can represent other factors besides differences in infection and transmission prevention practices.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.",

  "description" : "This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) standardized infection ratios (SIR) of hospital onset (HO) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream Infections (MRSA BSI) reported by  California general acute care hospitals other than long-term and rehabilitation acute care hospitals. The HO MRSA BSI SIR, which adjusts for significant risk factors, is calculated by comparing the number of MRSA BSI that occurred (or were observed) in the hospital in 2015 to the number that would be predicted based on the national referent MRSA BSI rate data.  MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when the first positive blood test is obtained after the third day of hospitalization. Risk factors found to be significant in predicting HO MRSA BSI incidence include hospital bed size, affiliation with a medical school, and the community burden of MRSA BSI as observed in patients admitted to the hospital. Adjusting for these factors provides for a more accurate comparison of hospitals’ infections. For more precise comparisons, NHSN only calculates a SIR when at least one HO MRSA BSI is predicted, which is determined by patient volume and other factors predictive of acquiring MRSA BSI. However, we calculated the SIR for such hospitals with HO MRSA BSI predicted less than one if the number of HO MRSA BSI predicted was ≥ 0.2. For each hospital with a MRSA BSI SIR, we performed a statistical analysis to determine if the observed number of infections was significantly different than the predicted number. Based on our statistical analysis we labeled each hospital’s MRSA BSI SIR as indicating: \r\n• No Different - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections, \r\n• Higher - high or more infections than predicted, or \r\n• Lower - low or fewer infections than predicted.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.",

The hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days.

CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Differences in rates for rehabilitation acute care hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in rehabilitation acute care hospitals is provided separately from the rates in long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals.  Patients in LTAC hospitals have longer lengths of stay, an established risk factor for CDI.  Also, specifically for LTAC and rehabilitation acute care hospitals, we include whether a hospital uses the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect CDI.  In this table, hospital rates of CDI for rehabilitation acute care hospitals have not been adjusted to account for the differences in sensitivity between PCR and other laboratory testing methods; therefore, rates from hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.",

  "description" : "This 2015 central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) rates file includes four patient care areas: 1) Critical Care Areas (CCAs) are nursing care areas that provide intensive observation, diagnosis, and therapeutic procedures for patients who are critically ill. These areas exclude step-down, intermediate, or telemetry care areas. 2) Neonatal Critical Care (NCC) Areas specialize in Level II/III and/or Level III critical care provided to newborns and infants. 3) General Care Areas (WARDS) include the following types of locations: stepdown general care locations specializing in patients that are hemodynamically stable; medical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of nonsurgical conditions; medical/surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of medical and/or surgical conditions; surgical general care locations providing evaluation and treatment for pre- or post-surgical conditions; long-term acute care locations specializing in patients requiring an extended stay in an acute care environment; adult rehabilitation general care locations providing care to patients who have lost function;  labor, delivery, recovery, postpartum general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of normal and high risk pregnancy patients; behavioral general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients with acute psychiatric or behavioral disorders; jail general care locations providing evaluation and treatment of patients who are in custody of law enforcement during their treatment; pediatric general care locations providing evaluation or treatment to any patient less than or equal to 18 years of age for any medical or surgical condition; and pediatric rehabilitation  locations providing care to patients less than or equal to 18 years of age who have lost function. 4) Special Care Areas (SCA) are nursing care areas which specialize in patients who undergo bone marrow (stem cell) transplant for the treatment of various disorders; or require management and treatment for cancer and/or blood disorders; or require postoperative care after solid organ transplant. This combined CLABSI rates table shows the hospital-specific CLABSI data and central line insertion practices (CLIP) adherence percent by patient care locations in CCAs, NCCs and one treatment area within SCA, \"Oncology - Medical/Surgical Critical Care\",  Permanent and Temporary Central Line Days. The CLABSI measures include the number of CLABSIs, central line-days, patient days, CLABSI rates and their 95% confidence intervals. We also performed statistical analyses to determine if the rates are statistically higher, lower, or no different than the California average rates by patient care locations. We know CLABSI rates are influenced by clinical and infection control practices related to central line insertion and maintenance procedures, patient-based risk factors, and surveillance methods. While stratifying CLABSI rates by patient care location makes rates more comparable, this data risk adjusted procedure cannot control for all individual patient factors that can affect CLABSI rates. A low CLABSI rate may reflect greater diligence with infection prevention or may result from less effective surveillance methods that detect fewer infections, including the failure to consistently apply all currently accepted standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. Similarly, a high rate may reflect the failure to consistently implement all recommended infection prevention practices or use more aggressive infection surveillance methods that can include the application of standardized surveillance definitions and protocols. \r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.",

  "description" : "Long-term acute care hospitals (LTACs) are defined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as providing care to patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay greater than 25 days. This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset (HO) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (MRSA BSI) reported by  California LTACs to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), during the time period January through December 2015. MRSA BSI cases are classified as HO when a positive blood sample is obtained on day four or later during a hospital stay, from a patient with no prior positive blood culture within the preceding two weeks. The HO MRSA BSI rate is calculated by dividing the number of cases by the total number of patient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The MRSA BSI rates in this data release are not risk adjusted because there are no such methods available at this time for LTACs. In addition to patient-based risk factors, the unadjusted LTAC MRSA BSI rates herein are also affected by facility bed size, community prevalence rate, clinical and infection control practices, and/or surveillance methods. While stratifying MRSA BSI rates by LTAC hospital type may make rates more comparable, it cannot control for all factors that can affect MRSA BSI rates. Therefore, comparisons between hospitals within this group should still be made with caution.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.",

  "description" : "The Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program is a federally-funded health and nutrition program that provides assistance to pregnant women, new mothers, infants and children under age five. WIC helps California families by providing food vouchers to individual participants based on their nutritional need and risk assessment. The food vouchers can be used to purchase healthy supplemental foods from over 4,000 WIC authorized vendor stores throughout the State. WIC also provides nutritional education, breastfeeding support, healthcare referrals and other community services. Participants must meet income guidelines and other criteria. Currently, 84 WIC agencies provide services monthly to approximately 1.3 million participants at over 650 sites in local communities throughout the State.\r\nThis file contains data on the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, specifically the number of participants who redeemed food vouchers by participant category both by county and statewide. In addition, it provides the number of food vouchers redeemed and dollar value of the food vouchers redeemed in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 on a month to month basis. The corresponding calendar months are based upon reference to the first day on which the food vouchers were valid to be used (the obligation month). Some of the monthly variation in the data can be attributed to the number of days and holidays in a month. Participant redeemed data in this dataset will not match published monthly participant reports as some certified participants are enrolled but do not receive or redeem food vouchers (i.e. fully breastfeeding infant).",

  "description" : "Long-term acute care is a hospital defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as a licensed general acute care hospital providing care for patients with medically complex conditions requiring an average length of stay for all patients of greater than 25 days. This table shows the incidence rates of hospital onset Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reported by California long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals.  The hospital onset (HO) CDI rate is calculated by dividing the number of HO CDI cases by the total inpatient days; the rate is then reported per 10,000 patient days. The rates are not risk adjusted and may reflect factors in the hospital that can affect the occurrence of CDI, such as transmission of the C. difficile bacteria and use of antimicrobials. CDI cases are classified as HO when the positive stool sample is obtained on day four or later during the hospital stay. Differences in rates for LTAC hospitals can result from differences in laboratory testing methodology, patient populations, infection and transmission prevention practices, antibiotic utilization, and/or community onset rates of CDI. HO CDI rate in LTAC hospitals is provided separately from the rates in rehabilitation acute care hospitals.  Patients in LTAC hospitals have longer lengths of stay, an established risk factor for CDI.  Also, specifically for LTAC and rehabilitation acute care hospitals, we include whether a hospital uses the polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) to detect CDI.  In this table, hospital rates of CDI for LTAC hospitals have not been adjusted to account for the differences in sensitivity between PCR and other laboratory testing methods; therefore, rates from hospitals using different types of laboratory tests are not comparable.\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.",

This dataset is a selected subset of the entire report, available on the California Department of Social Services, Research and Data Reports (RADR) website at http://www.cdss.ca.gov/research/.  CalWORKs is a welfare program that gives cash aid and services to eligible needy California families.  The program serves all 58 counties in the state and is operated locally by county welfare departments.  If a family has little or no cash and needs housing, food, utilities, clothing or medical care, they may be eligible to receive immediate short-term help.  Families that apply and qualify for ongoing assistance receive benefits each month to help pay for housing, food and other necessary expenses.  Monthly CalWORKs data is collected from the counties through submission of the CA 237CW CalWORKs Cash Grant Movement Report, which is used to report statistical information on CalWORKs caseload movement for Two Parent Families, Zero Parent Families, All Other Families, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Timed-Out Cases and Safety Net/Fleeing Felon/Long-Term Sanction Cases (SN/FF/LTS).",

  "description" : "This dataset includes demographics of clients served by the Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (Family PACT) Program between 1997 and 2015. Family PACT is administered by the California Department of Health Care Services, Office of Family Planning (OFP) and has been operating since 1997 to provide family planning and reproductive health services at no cost to California’s low-income residents of reproductive age. The program offers comprehensive family planning services, including contraception, pregnancy testing, and sterilization, as well as sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and limited cancer screening services. Demographic variables listed in the table include sex, age, race/ethnicity, language, and parity.

  "description" : "This dataset includes information on the number of providers delivering services through the Family Planning, Access, Care, and Treatment (Family PACT) Program between 2003 and 2015. Delivering Family PACT services was defined as having been reimbursed for at least one claim for any services through Family PACT. Providers for whom all Family PACT claims have been denied were not designated as delivering providers. Family PACT is administered by the California Department of Health Care Services, Office of Family Planning (OFP) and has been operating since 1997 to provide family planning and reproductive health services at no cost to California’s low-income residents of reproductive age. The program offers comprehensive family planning services, including contraception, pregnancy testing, and sterilization, as well as sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and limited cancer screening services. All Family PACT providers must also be enrolled as Medi-Cal providers, and Medi-Cal clinician providers who are not enrolled in Family PACT may provide Family PACT services by referral from an enrolled Family PACT provider. Variables listed in this dataset include enrolled FPACT clinician providers, Medi-Cal clinician providers (not enrolled in Family PACT), total clinician providers, pharmacies, labs, and the percent change in all of these variables from the previous fiscal year. Providers are counted according to their provider type. For example, if a laboratory or pharmacy is associated with a clinician provider both the laboratory or pharmacy and the clinician are counted. In the seventeenth full fiscal year of operation, FY 2013-15, 7,786 providers were reimbursed for services delivered under the Family PACT Program. Of these, 2,817 were clinician providers, 4,827 were pharmacy providers, and 142 were laboratories. Of the 2,817 clinician providers, 2,276 were also enrolled in Family PACT. The remaining 541 clinician providers delivered services on a referral basis and are referred to simply as Medi-Cal providers. Medi-Cal providers often deliver specialized services a Family PACT provider does not perform, such as sterilization.",

Medi-Cal clinician providers who are not enrolled in Family PACT may provide Family PACT services by referral, and are referred to simply as Medi-Cal Providers. As seen in the chart, there has been some variation in the number of enrolled FPACT clinicians delivering Family PACT services since 2003. The largest declines can be seen in the number of Medi-Cal providers who delivered Family PACT services. Compared to FY 2012-13 there was a relatively sharp decline in the number of Medi-Cal providers (-14%) in FY 2013-14 and lesser declines in the number of enrolled clinicians (-0.9%). The steep decline in the number of Medi-Cal providers in FY 2013-14 is likely due to the elimination of mammography services as a covered Family PACT benefit on January 1, 2014. Medi-Cal providers often deliver specialized services a Family PACT provider does not perform, such as mammography services.",

  "description" : "This table shows the Center for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) risk adjusted Standardized infection ratios (SIR) for surgical site infections (SSIs)  reported by a hospital for 24 Operative procedures that are listed in the Data Dictionary. The SIR is calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted infections. The number of predicted infections is calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline time period 2006 through 2008, which represents a reference population’s SSI experience. The SIR calculated only if the number of observed is at least one, to enforce a minimum precision criterion and these SIRs are based on the date of procedure, not the date of event. All procedure and infection data entered before May 4, 2015 for surgical procedures performed between January 1 and December 31, 2014 were downloaded from NHSN for this data release. The SIR used for this table is risk adjusted SIR that considers only complex SSI identified during hospital Admission or Readmission to the same hospital following inpatient surgeries and hereafter referred to as SIR.  The hospital submitted procedure counts and infection counts are displayed along with an SIR and, the 95 percent confidence interval for the SIR and the statistical comparison as follow:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       *    No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  •    High -  more infections than predicted,  or\r\n•     Low - fewer infections than predicted   \r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.",

The dataset is a selected subset of the entire report, available on the California Department of Social Services, Research and Data Reports (RADR) website at http://www.cdss.ca.gov/research.  CalWORKs is a welfare program that gives cash aid and services to eligible needy California families.  The program serves all 58 counties in the state and is operated locally by county welfare departments.  If a family has little or no cash and needs housing, food, utilities, clothing or medical care, they may be eligible to receive immediate short-term help.  Families that apply and qualify for ongoing assistance receive benefits each month to help pay for housing, food and other necessary expenses.  Monthly CalWORKs data is collected from the counties through submission of the CA 237CW CalWORKs Cash Grant Movement Report, which is used to report statistical information on CalWORKs caseload movement for Two Parent Families, Zero Parent Families, All Other Families, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Timed-Out Cases and Safety Net/Fleeing Felon/Long-Term Sanction Cases (SN/FF/LTS).",

Counts of disorders that were <6 were suppressed, as described in the attached Data Dictionary. The disorders included are part of the core recommended panel put forth by the Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (SACHDNC) established under the Section 1111 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, 42 U.S.C. 300b-10, as amended in the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act of 2008. The Committee recommends that every state newborn screening program include a uniform screening panel that currently includes 31 core disorders; the Genetic Disease Screening program screens for all of the core conditions excluding newborn hearing loss screening and critical congenital heart disease screening which are programs administered by the Department of Health Care Services.",

  "description" : "The California Tobacco Advertising Survey (CTAS) is a longitudinal cohort study of California stores that sell cigarettes. The data table shows the percentage of stores with tobacco advertisements near candy and those with tobacco advertisements below three feet in 2008 and 2011, broken down by store type. Tobacco advertisements placed below three feet are easier for children to see, and advertisements near candy are in a location that is likely to draw a child's attention. The sampling excluded stores that required either club membership (e.g., Costco or golf courses) or had minimum-age restrictions (e.g., bars). Also excluded were stores that were unusual store categories that were unlikely to display or advertise tobacco products, such as donut shops. The baseline sample (CTAS 2008) is historical. The original sample was derived from a 1997 list of 40,186 cigarette retailers, as enumerated by the California Board of Equalization (BOE). The sample stores and addresses were matched to the 2011 retailer licensing list, which was supplied by the BOE to the California Tobacco Control Program. Of the 545 stores with valid data in 2008, 442 (81.1 percent) were verified by phone as still selling cigarettes. A randomly selected list of stores from the 2011 licensing list was also phone verified. This list was used to replace all 2008 stores that were no longer in business or no longer sold cigarettes. It was also used to increase the sample size by approximately 100 stores in order to better detect differences between store types.",

  "description" : "This table shows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) risk adjusted standardized infection ratios (SIR) for surgical site infections (SSIs) reported by hospitals for 24 operative procedures that are listed in the Data Dictionary. The SIR is calculated by dividing the number of observed infections by the number of predicted infections. The number of predicted infections is calculated using SSI probabilities estimated from multivariate logistic regression models constructed from NHSN data during a baseline time period 2006 through 2008, which represents a reference population’s SSI experience. To enforce a minimum precision criterion, an SIR is calculated only if the number of observed infections is at least one. SIRs are based on the date of procedure, not the date of the SSI event. All procedure and infection data entered before May 1, 2014 for surgical procedures performed between January 1 and December 31, 2013 were downloaded from NHSN for this data release. The SIR used for this table is a risk adjusted SIR that considers only complex SSI identified during hospital admission or readmission to the same hospital following inpatient surgeries. The procedure counts and infection counts submitted by each hospital are displayed along with an SIR, the 95 percent confidence interval for the SIR, and the statistical comparison as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       *    No difference - no difference in number of observed and predicted infections                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  •    High -  more infections than predicted,  or\r\n•    Low - fewer infections than predicted\r\nTo link the CDPH facility IDs with those from other Departments, like OSHPD, please reference the \"Licensed Facility Cross-Walk\" Open Data table at https://chhs.data.ca.gov/Facilities-and-Services/Licensed-Facility-Cross-Walk/tthg-z4mf.",

  "description" : "Adult smoking prevalence in California, males and females aged 18+, starting in 1984. Caution must be used when comparing the percentages of smokers over time as the definition of ‘current smoker’ was broadened in 1996, and the survey methods were changed in 2012. Current cigarette smoking is defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and now smoking every day or some days. Prior to 1996, the definition of current cigarettes smoking was having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and smoking now. Due to the methodology change in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012.

    "description" : "Adult smoking prevalence in California, males and females aged 18+, starting in 1984. Caution must be used when comparing the percentages of smokers over time as the definition of ‘current smoker’ was broadened in 1996, and the survey methods were changed in 2012. Current cigarette smoking is defined as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and now smoking every day or some days. Prior to 1996, the definition of current cigarettes smoking was having smoked at least 100 cigarettes in lifetime and smoking now. Due to the methodology change in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend not conducting analyses where estimates from 1984 – 2011 are compared with analyses using the new methodology, beginning in 2012. This includes analyses examining trends and changes over time. (For more information, please see the narrative description.)",

  "description" : "This table contains data on the annual number of fatal and severe road traffic injuries per population and per miles traveled by transport mode, for California, its regions, counties, county divisions, cities/towns, and census tracts. Injury data is from the Statewide Integrated Traffic Records System (SWITRS), California Highway Patrol (CHP), 2002-2010 data from the Transportation Injury Mapping System (TIMS) . The table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project of the Office of Health Equity (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/Pages/HealthyCommunityIndicators.aspx). Transportation accidents are the second leading cause of death in California for people under the age of 45 and account for an average of 4,018 deaths per year (2006-2010). Risks of injury in traffic collisions are greatest for motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists and lowest for bus and rail passengers. Minority communities bear a disproportionate share of pedestrian-car fatalities; Native American male pedestrians experience 4 times the death rate as Whites or Asians, and African-Americans and Latinos experience twice the rate as Whites or Asians.

The data presented in this table are for quarterly aggregates of sampling media per site.  Dose per quarter is reported in millirem Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE); all other values are radiological activity concentrations reported in units of picoCuries per cubic meter.  Any positive result less than the minimum detectable activity is attributable to statistical measurement noise, and results are reported even in the case of non-detection.  Beryllium-7 and Potassium-40 are naturally occurring radionuclides.  The other radionuclides in the dataset are fission products.  Detection of Cesium-137 is not necessarily indicative of a new release because atmospheric nuclear weapons testing distributed significant amounts across the world that are still measurable.",

  "description" : "The purpose of the California Wellness Plan (CWP) Data Reference Guide (Reference Guide) is to provide access to the lowest-level data for each CWP Objective; lowest-level data source, instructions to access data, and additional details are described. Some CWP Objectives do not have program leads, data sources, baselines, and/or targets, but are included because they were a result of CDPH program or partner input and were felt to be important to the reduction of chronic disease incidence, prevalence, and health disparities. Agencies, programs and/or partners identified with an objective may be either data stewards and/or engaged in activities to achieve the target, but may not have adequate resources for statewide activities.  Developmental Objectives will be updated as information becomes available. \r\n\r\nBackground: The California Wellness Plan, California's Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Plan was released February 2014 by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).  The overarching goal of CWP is Equity in Health and Wellbeing; additional CWP Goals include: 1) Healthy Communities, 2) Optimal Health Systems Linked with Community Prevention, 3) Accessible and Usable Health Information, and 4) Prevention  Sustainability and Capacity. All CWP objectives fall under the framework of Let's Get Healthy California Task Force priorities.",
